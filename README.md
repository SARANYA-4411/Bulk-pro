# Bulk-pro

The Bulkpro management team has requested the data analyst team to look into the decline
of overall orders in the Platinum category placed, both in terms of the number of orders and
in terms of daily product quantities ordered. After analyzing key metrics such as monthly
total order quantity, daily total order quantity, average daily order quantity per product, new
products onboarded, and sales of new products, we have come up with some insights.
From our analysis, we observed that the monthly total order quantity and daily total order
quantity showed a steady decline from January to May, with a significant drop in orders from
March to April. This drop can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic that hit the world
during the same time. The average daily order quantity per product remained relatively
constant throughout the period, indicating that there was no significant change in demand for
individual products in the Platinum category.
